# Level 13

## Vulnerability

## Context
```
level13@SnowCrash:~$ ls -l
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag13 level13 7303 Aug 30  2015 level13
```
## Solution
Looks like a binary. Let's try running it. 
```
level13@SnowCrash:~$ ./level13
UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242
```
It looks like it wants our UID (user id) to be 4242.
Let's verify our username and user id.
```
level13@SnowCrash:~$ whoami
level13
level13@SnowCrash:~$ echo $UID
2013
```
Unforunately, you cannot change your user's UID when it is logged in a session. <br/>
We're going to have to find another way. 
We can use gdb to change the owner of a currently running process, like this:
```
level13@SnowCrash:~$ gdb ./level13
(gdb) attach process_id
(gdb) call putenv ("UID=4242")
(gdb) detach
```
Unfortunately, when we try this we get the following message:
```
No symbol table is loaded.  Use the "file" command.
```
GDB is telling you is that your binary does not have any debugging info in it.<br/>
Without debug info, certain commands will not work. But others will. <br/>
Let's try something else.
