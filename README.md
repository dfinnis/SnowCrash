# SnowCrash

Discover cyber security through 15 little challenges.

In the folder for each level you will find:

* ```flag``` password for next level

* ```README.md``` how to find the password

See the [subject](https://github.com/dfinnis/SnowCrash/blob/master/subject.pdf) for more details.


## Getting Started

### Virtual Machine setup

First download from 42 [*SnowCrash.iso*](https://projects.intra.42.fr/uploads/document/document/2831/SnowCrash.iso).

On Mac OSX, install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

In VirtualBox create a new VM (click new).

* Name and operating system - Type: Linux, Version: (Oracle 64-bit).

Continue through all the next steps with the default settings:

* Memory size: 4MB
* Hard disk: Create a disk now
* Hard disk file type: VDI(VirtualBox Disk Image)
* Storage on physical hard disk: Dynamically allocated
* File size: 12,00GB

Next click settings > Network > Adapter 1 > Attached to: Bridged Adapter.

Still in settings click Storage > Right of "Controller: IDE" there is a CD icon with a + sign (add optical drive).

Click Add Disk Image, and select *SnowCrash.iso*

Then start the VM (click start), it should show the VM IP address and prompt user to login.

### SSH connect

Log in from a separate shell as user *level00* with password *level00*.

```ssh level00@{VM_IP} -p 4242```

Great, we are logged in!

### Goal

Now we want to find the password for user *flag00*, see [level00/](https://github.com/dfinnis/SnowCrash/tree/master/level00) for how.

Log in as user *flag00*.

```su flag00```

Run *getflag* to find the password for user *level01*.

```getflag```

Log in as user *level01*.

```su level01```

This repeats for each level.
